NAME
    Mojolicious::Plugin::OnFork - Do Something Whenever a Worker Starts

VERSION
    Version 0.002

SYNOPSIS
      # Mojolicious
      $self->plugin('OnFork' => sub { srand })
        if $ENV{HYPNOTOAD_APP};

      # Mojolicious::Lite
      plugin OnFork => sub { srand }
        if $ENV{HYPNOTOAD_APP};

DESCRIPTION
    Mojolicious::Plugin::OnFork is a plugin to easily define code, that is
    executed whenever a new worker process of the web server forks.

    All this plugin actually does is

      Mojo::IOLoop->timer(0 => $code)

    The motivation for this plugin was, that hypnotoad does not call "srand"
    in perlfunc after a "fork" in perlfunc, so your workers probably all get
    the same sequence of "random" numbers from "rand" in perlfunc. The
    Mojolicious maintainers are reluctant to fix this problem. OTOH I want
    to hide gory Mojolicious guts like the above code from my applications.

METHODS
    Mojolicious::Plugin::OnFork inherits all methods from
    Mojolicious::Plugin and implements the following new ones.

  "register"
    Register plugin hooks in Mojolicious application.
